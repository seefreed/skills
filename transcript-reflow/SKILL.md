# Transcript Reflow

## Overview

Rewrite transcript text into clear, grammatically correct English with sensible sentences and paragraphs while preserving meaning and stage directions.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the full transcript

Scan the entire file to understand topic flow, speaker intent, and where paragraphs should naturally break.

### 2. Reflow and rewrite

- Merge broken line fragments into full sentences.
- Normalize punctuation, capitalization, and spacing.
- Break long run-ons into readable sentences.
- Keep stage directions or cues in parentheses on their own lines.
- Keep the voice conversational; do not summarize or remove content.

### 3. Output rules

- Save the cleaned version to a new file with a clear name (e.g., `*_new.txt`).
- Keep ASCII-only text unless the source already contains non-ASCII.
- Preserve important proper nouns, model names, and product terms.

### 4. Quick self-check

- Read through to ensure paragraph transitions are smooth.
- Confirm no content was dropped or added.
